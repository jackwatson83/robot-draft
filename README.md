# Robot Auto-Battler
Inspired by games in the Auto-Battle genre (such as Dota Underlords and TeamFight Tactics), I developed this prototype game in which players
build robots and pit them against each other.

This project was submitted for a module during my Masters course.

# AI
In this prototype, the AI is simplistic and rigid - targets are assigned manually to ensure a functional demonstration for my submission.

# Local Multiplayer
This iteration of the project has the two players playing together on the same keyboard, using separate control schemes (WASD and Arrow Keys).
Initially this was intended for quick access to debug multiplayer aspects, but testing turned out to be fun, so I developed the feature more.

# Custom Unity Editors
Much of the game's data is stored in Scriptable Object Assets - Control Scheme data as well as Robot Parts (used for building robots).
For ease of use, I developed some simple editor windows which allowed me to create these Scriptable Objects much faster than normal.
